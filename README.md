# React Pokedex
## Motivation
This project aim to be a full modern Pokedex app where you can see all existing Pokemon and find a lot of infos about them.  
I started this because well... I **LOVE** Pokemon! And i was hoping to learn React and Redux at the same time, while doing something i'm passionate about.  
It's on Github so i can "try" to code the "open source way" (Issues, Pull requests and stuff...).  
So really, i'm really excited about this! If you read this, and want to help by ANY mean, you're totally soooo welcome!  

## How can I help?
Well, thanks for asking.
### If you want to do a pull-request
First read CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and if everything is fine clone the project :

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/msdos14/react-pokedex
cd react-pokedex
npm install
```
Then create a local branch :
``` bash
git branch branch_name
git checkout branch_name
```
I will create some to-dos, so you are free to pick one or add any feature you want really.  
Once you're done, send a pull request to the **dev** branch and i'll take a look ASAP.  
``` bash
# add your change
git add .
git commit -m "This change is sooo amazing!"
git checkout dev
git merge branch_name
git push origin dev
```

### I have ideas but can't or don't want to code it
I understand, no problem.  
You can just open an Issue about your bug or idea and i'll look at it.

### I have something i would like to tell you
Cool, just send me an email at _ryoichifandry@gmail.com_ and i'll gladly talk to anyone willing to help me in this!

## Roadmap
I'll add every milestones of the app as it _grows_, i hope it grows...  
So here they are for now:  
- [x] Initial setups
- [ ] Install additional tools needed
- [ ] Create an ugly looking Pokedex page as a startup for what's coming next
